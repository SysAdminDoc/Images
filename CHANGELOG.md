# Changelog

All notable changes to **Images** are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Branding

- Added the project logo. `src/Images/Resources/logo.png` ships as a WPF `<Resource>` for in-app use; `src/Images/Resources/icon.ico` is a 7-frame multi-resolution Windows app icon (16/24/32/48/64/128/256, Catmull-Rom downscale from a square-padded 431×431 source) wired via `<ApplicationIcon>` in `Images.csproj` — the built `Images.exe` now shows the logo in Explorer, the taskbar, and Alt-Tab. `icon.svg` is a PNG-embedded SVG wrapper for web/README contexts.
- Added the project banner at `assets/banner.png` and embedded it at the top of the README.

### CI

- Bumped release workflow actions off the deprecated Node 20 runner: `actions/checkout@v4` → `@v6`, `actions/setup-dotnet@v4` → `@v5`. GitHub removes Node 20 runners on 2026-06-02 — this clears that deprecation well ahead of the deadline.

### Docs

- Added `ROADMAP.md` tracking v0.1.2 polish + branding pass.
- README architecture tree now shows `Resources/icon.ico`, `icon.svg`, `logo.png` instead of the "not yet added" placeholder.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Folder watcher (`FileSystemWatcher`) now actually runs — external add/delete/rename from Explorer or another app refreshes the list without pressing F5. The position chip updates live, and if the currently displayed file vanishes, the viewer advances to the next slot the navigator lands on.
- `BoolToVis` converter is now declared in `Themes/DarkTheme.xaml` (single source of truth, available to any view) instead of being redeclared per-window.
- `ImageLoader.Load` narrows its WIC catch to decode/format exceptions — `OutOfMemoryException` and thread aborts now propagate instead of silently falling through to Magick.NET. The WIC-path `MemoryStream` is disposed deterministically.
- `DirectoryNavigator.Open` short-circuits when called with a path inside the already-watched folder — no more full rescans on repeat drops from the same directory.
- `DirectoryNavigator.Rescan` catches transient IO / ACL / disconnection errors and keeps the prior list instead of throwing to the UI thread.

### Docs

- README zoom row clarifies wheel-zoom anchors on the cursor; removed the stray `Ctrl+wheel` alias claim that the code never honored.
- README architecture tree no longer claims a shipped `Resources/icon.ico` (icon is a v0.1.2 follow-up).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-04-24

Initial release.

- WPF / .NET 9 image viewer with WIC + Magick.NET decode pipeline (~100 formats incl. BMP/JPG/PNG/GIF/TIFF/WEBP/HEIC/ICO/JXL/AVIF/PSD/TGA/RAW).
- Windows 7 Photo Viewer–inspired chrome in Catppuccin Mocha dark theme.
- Hover-reveal left/right navigation arrows; Left/Right/Home/End/Space/Backspace keyboard navigation with wrap-around.
- Natural-sort directory scan on open; auto-refresh when files are added/removed.
- Split stem/extension rename editor with 600 ms debounced auto-save, live conflict preview, commit-on-navigation.
- Recent Renames panel with one-click undo for the last 10 renames.
- Zoom (wheel / Ctrl+wheel), pan (drag), fit-to-window, 1:1, rotate, delete-to-recycle-bin.
- Command-line: `Images.exe "C:\path\to\image.jpg"` opens file and populates directory.
